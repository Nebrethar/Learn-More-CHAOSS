Below are some examples of CHAOSS code projects you may contribute to.

## GrimoireLab

GrimoireLab is a set of free, open source software tools for software development analytics. They gather data from several platforms involved in software development (Git, GitHub, Jira, Bugzilla, Gerrit, Mailing lists, Jenkins, Slack, Discourse, Confluence, StackOverflow, [and more](https://chaoss.github.io/grimoirelab/)), merge and organize it in a database, and produce visualizations, actionable dashboards, and analytics of all of it.  

GrimoireLab is focused on analyzing activity, community, and processes. Nonetheless, it can be easily tailored for other aims, and integrated with other tools.

## Augur

If you want to quickly and flexibly understand a set of open source software projects, give Augur a try! "Augur" is the core software, and "augur-community-reports", "augur-spdx" (for licensing), and "Auggie", which is a slack plugin for notifications that enables you to get push messages from Augur.

Want to get started right away without doing much work? Email a list of repository to GitHub/GitLab organizations to Augur at s@groupinformatics.org with the subject line "Augur Instance", and we will respond with a timeline within a day. The more repositories you request, the longer it takes to gather data (FYI).
